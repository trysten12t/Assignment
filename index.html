 	<h2> Workshop 1: Hello World</h2>
 	<p>In this workshop our goal was to output "Hello World" to the python terminal. 
	   This was easily done by simply typing 'print "Hello World"' </p>

 	<h2> Workshop 2: LED</h2>
 	<p>For this workshop the goal was to make a LED light up. We needed to make 2 files
           for this. One to turn the LED on and the other to turn it off. But firstly we had <br>
           to setup the circuit. We used a resistor so that the LED doesn't blow. The Raspberry 
           Pi was used as a power supply. The 2 power outputs that were chosen were GPIO17 and <br>
           GPIO18. The LED-ON file prints out "LED on" whenever the LED is turned on. The LED-OFF 
           file does the opposite and prints "LED off".</p>

 	<h2> Workshop 3: Blink</h2>
 	<p>This workshop is similar to the last one. For this one the 2 LED's that we used had 
           to blink on and off. To this we needed to change the python file. The circuit stayed <br>
           the same. Instead of having 2 files we only needed one. This file had a while loop which 
           was used to make the LED's blink. Everytime the light flashed "LED on" was printed, and <br>
	   when the LED was off "LED off" was printed. After Loop was equal to 100 the console printed "Finished".</p>

 	<h2> Workshop 4: Button</h2>
 	<p>In this workshop we had our console print "Button Pressed", the date and the time, for 
	   everytime the button was pressed. This was done with a 5 second delay between button presses.</p>

 	<h2> Workshop 4: Buzzer</h2>
 	<p> For this workshop we made a a circuit with a buzzer.We made the buzzer say "SOS" in morsecode.
	    You can choose how often you want the morsecode to repeat.</p>
